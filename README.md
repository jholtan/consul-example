Consul example
==============


Initializing
------------

Requires [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/).

Start the Vagrant images. This will also install Consul on the virtual servers.
```
$ vagrant up
```

To log into the virtual machines use
```
$ vagrant ssh <app1|app2|...>
```

Starting consul:
```
$ sudo start consul
```

Consul will log to `/var/log/consul.log`

Bootstrapping the cluster
-------------------------

Start one of the servers in bootstrap mode
```
$ consul agent -config-file /etc/consul.d/bootstrap.conf
```

The server will bootstrap the cluster and elect itself as leader. Then bring the
other servers up by running the command
```
$ sudo start consul
```
To have a running server join the cluster bootstrapped by the leader, use
```
$ cluster join <ip address of leader>
```

As long as you have 3 or more servers in the cluster, you can bring down the 
leader and restart it in normal mode.


Enabling encryption
-------------------

**Gossip protocol encryption**

Enabling gossip protocol encryption protects your system against eavesdropping,
data tampering and fake nodes.

The command `consul keygen` will generate a 16-bit base64 encoded key that
can be used as the shared secret. If the provisioning script locates a file
called `gossip_secret` in the root of this project, it will use the contents of
that file as the shared secret.

```
$ consul keygen > gossip_secret
```

All agents in the cluster need to have the same 16-bit key in order to 
communicate with eachother.

**RPC protocol encryption**

The RPC protocol supports TLS encryption. This example does not enable TLS
encryption.

Services and health checks
--------------------------

**Services**



```
{
  "ID": "nginx",
  "Name": "Nginx Reverse Proxy",
  "Tags": [
    "master"
  ],
  "Port": 80,
  "Check": {
    "Script": "curl -s -I http://localhost/ui/",
    "Interval": "10s"
  }
}
```
to `http://localhost:8080/v1/agent/service/register`

**Health checks**

To register a health check you can POST 
```
{
  "ID": "hw-health-check",
  "Name": "Hello World Health Check",
  "Notes": "Simple example of a check",
  "Script": "curl -s http://localhost:8090/",
  "Interval": "10s"
}
```

to `http://localhost:8080/v1/agent/check/register`

DNS interface
-------------

`dig @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 servicename.service.consul.`

`dig @127.0.0.1 -p 8600 nodename.node.consul.`


Key/value store
---------------

The Key/value store is accessible through a [HTTP API](https://www.consul.io/docs/agent/http.html)

`curl http://localhost:8500/v1/kv/?recurse`
